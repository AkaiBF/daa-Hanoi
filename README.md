# Towers of Hanoi
## A Divide & Conquer Algorithm

The Towers of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle designed by Édouard Lucas in 1883.
In this game we have three sticks. One of them has a stack of disks with different 
radius. The smallest disks can't be stacked on another one bigger. The objective
of the game is to move the tower from a stick to another.
